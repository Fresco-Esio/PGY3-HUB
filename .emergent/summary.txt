The AI engineer was tasked with validating and completing a PGY3-HUB mind mapping application. Initially, the focus was on ensuring existing features were functional. Key problems encountered included a missing  dependency, an incorrect  in the frontend's environment configuration, and complex node positioning issues. Multiple attempts were made to fix node dragging and clustering, often involving conflicts with the force layout,  positioning, and  race conditions. A  was crucial in identifying the race condition and duplicate React Flow props. Despite visual updates to data, the UI was not reflecting node movements. The latest critical finding, as highlighted by the user, is that the search function's direct manipulation of node styles (using  and CSS transforms) is causing a conflict with React Flow's internal positioning system, leading to nodes being stuck. The AI engineer is currently in the process of deconstructing and reimplementing the search functionality to use CSS classes and avoid direct style manipulation, but has encountered a Maximum update depth exceeded error.

<product_requirements>
The PGY3-HUB is an immersive mind-mapping application for psychiatry residents. It helps organize psychiatric knowledge, clinical cases, tasks, and literature. The application features a React frontend with  for mind mapping, Tailwind CSS for styling, and dual backend support (FastAPI/Python, Express.js/Node.js) using local JSON file storage.

The initial task was to review the existing repository, ensure all described features are functional, complete any needing development, fix errors, and maintain theme consistency.

Key components include:
*   **Data Models**: PsychiatricTopic, PatientCase, Task, Literature, and Connections.
*   **Mind Map Visualization**: Interactive graph with , , ,  node types, custom floating edges, and D3.js for force-directed layout (lazy-loaded).
*   **Performance**: Lazy loading, memoization, debounced auto-save (800ms) to localStorage and backend, optimistic updates, and error boundaries.
*   **Functionality Fixes Required**:
    *   Ensure all nodes are visible and correctly positioned.
    *   Enable node dragging, allowing users to freely reposition nodes.
    *   Ensure node positions persist correctly after dragging and on application reload.
    *   Address conflicts where nodes cluster together or appear off-screen.
    *   Repair and reimplement search functionality to avoid interfering with node interactions and positioning.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React 19 / Create React App**: Frontend framework.
-   **FastAPI / Express.js**: Dual backend support with local JSON file storage.
-   **@xyflow/react (React Flow)**: Core library for interactive mind mapping visualization.
-   **D3-force**: Used for force-directed graph layouts.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
-   **Tiptap**: Rich text editing.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication.
-   **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useCallback, useRef) with debounced auto-save.
-   **CRACO**: For custom Webpack configuration.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application handling RESTful API endpoints for mind map data (topics, cases, tasks, literature, connections). It uses local JSON files for storage.
    -   **Changes**:  was initially referenced for data storage, but  also existed.  function was adjusted to correctly handle data cleaning and ensure proper JSON structure before sending to FastAPI.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Contains environment variables for the backend, specifically  and .
    -   **Changes**: No changes to this file in the trajectory.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages frontend Node.js dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes**:  was added as a dependency to resolve a module not found error.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables for the frontend, notably .
    -   **Changes**:  was corrected from an external preview URL to  to ensure communication with the local backend.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, containing the core logic for mind map visualization, state management, node creation, dragging, and interaction with the backend. It integrates React Flow, Tiptap, and D3.js.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   ****: Modified to prevent force layout from overriding saved positions and ensure nodes get proper individual positions using  for initial placement if no position exists.
        -   ****: Optimized to ensure position changes are correctly processed and persisted.
        -   ****: Modified to save position updates to the backend, not just localStorage. Its declaration order was also fixed to resolve scope issues.
        -   **ReactFlow component**: Duplicate  and  props were removed.  was explicitly set to .
        -   **Node creation logic (within NodeSelector context)**: Changed from using  to a grid-based layout (utilizing  principles) to prevent new nodes from stacking.
        -   **Search functionality ( useEffect)**: This was the most heavily modified area. Initially, it used  and the  prop, which broke dragging. These were removed. The entire search implementation was later deconstructed and is in the process of being reimplemented to use CSS classes () for visual feedback, avoiding direct  manipulation and conflicting transforms.
-   **/app/frontend/src/utils/performanceUtils.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Contains utility functions for performance optimization, including  for grid-based node positioning.
    -   **Changes**: This file was read and its  function was leveraged in  for node positioning.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the Maximum update depth exceeded error and complete the reimplementation of the search functionality using CSS classes () and avoiding direct  style manipulation.
-   Ensure that, after the search function is repaired, the node dragging and positioning systems are fully functional without any conflicts.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of overhauling the search functionality due to its direct interference with React Flow's internal positioning and dragging systems. The user explicitly stated that the search was causing issues by modifying node styles through , applying conflicting CSS transforms, and setting , which made nodes non-interactive. The goal is to reimplement search using React Flow's built-in filtering mechanisms and apply visual feedback via CSS classes () instead of inline styles.

The AI engineer has already:
1.  Removed the problematic   that directly manipulated React Flow nodes.
2.  Cleaned up edge visibility effects.
3.  Simplified the competing search query processing logic.

However, during the re-implementation, the AI engineer encountered a Maximum update depth exceeded error in the browser console. This indicates a circular dependency or an infinite re-render loop, suggesting that the current approach for applying CSS classes or managing state related to search visibility is creating an uncontrolled update cycle. The immediate focus is on resolving this render loop issue to proceed with the search re-implementation.

Debug and fix the Maximum update depth exceeded error by identifying and breaking the circular dependency in the search re-implementation.
