The previous AI engineer meticulously developed and refined a complex interactive timeline feature for the PGY-3 HQ application's Case Node modal. Initially, the project established a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack, integrating a basic  component. The trajectory shows a strong focus on performance and dynamic user experience, transitioning from a basic zigzag layout to a D3.js-driven force-directed simulation, and later to an HTML Canvas rendering for performance. Significant architectural refactoring was undertaken in two phases: first, extracting monolithic node components from  and establishing a context-based state management, then modularizing the timeline and creating a unified modal system. Key challenges involved resolving D3 dependency issues, fixing prop mismatches post-refactoring, and iteratively refining D3 physics, animations, and card behaviors based on detailed user feedback. The current task revolves around finalizing animation behavior and integrating scroll functionality.

The primary objective is to redesign the Timeline tab within the Case Node modal of the PGY-3 HQ application. This feature requires a dynamic, editable vertical timeline displaying paired insights. Each timeline entry must be a hoverable node with two floating panels (Patient Narrative on left, Clinical Notes on right). Hovering expands previews; clicking expands fully into an editable mode (only one node editable at a time). An “+ Add Entry” button should add new nodes in edit mode, and double-clicking between nodes should insert new nodes with a pop-in effect. Nodes must be drag-and-drop reorderable, preserving , while maintaining a zigzag angular path. Cards should be anchored to node corners based on the bend (e.g., left bend: Patient Narrative connects bottom-right, Clinical Notes top-left; right bend: Patient Narrative top-right, Clinical Notes bottom-left) with subtle visual connections and float above the timeline. The timeline must feature D3.js-inspired force simulation for nodes (draggable, repellable, click-to-pin/unpin), smooth transitions (200-300ms) for interactions, and node-associated cards that appear only on hover (with a slight dismissal delay) and become editable on click (saving on click outside). The pop-in animation should only occur for *newly added* nodes. The timeline must also support scrolling when its length exceeds the modal height.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and fix the issue where nodes reset position and animation replays on hover.
- Ensure the save deferring function does not cause node instability.
- Integrate scroll functionality for the timeline when it extends beyond the modal's length.

<current_work>
The immediate previous work involved debugging and attempting to fix persistent issues with the D3 physics timeline despite significant refactoring and prior fixes. Specifically, the user reported that On hover, the node positions are resetting then the animation is playing again and that The pop-in animation for new nodes causes all of the nodes to replay their animation, but that is not what we wanted. The AI engineer identified the root cause as the D3 simulation being re-initialized on every state change, likely exacerbated by the save deferring function causing re-renders, and is currently working on preventing this. Additionally, the user explicitly requested a scroll feature for the timeline when its content exceeds the modal's visible area. The AI engineer has made initial edits to address the animation and node resetting, and has just begun implementing the scroll functionality by creating new directories or modifying existing files to support this feature. The last action was an  command to add scroll functionality.
