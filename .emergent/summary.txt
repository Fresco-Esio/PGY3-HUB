<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a psychiatry resident dashboard, transforming it from a static idea to a dynamic mind-mapping application. Key phases included establishing the core React/FastAPI/MongoDB structure, implementing mind map visualization with React Flow, and enhancing interactivity through editable nodes, drag-and-drop, and dynamic layouts via . Major achievements involved robust local data persistence, CSV export, and significant visual/UX enhancements like toast notifications and multi-sided node handles. The engineer also debugged critical issues like subpage freezing and initial connection persistence problems, although a recurring connection persistence issue remains. The work primarily focused on  for frontend logic and UI, demonstrating iterative development with a strong emphasis on user experience and data integrity.

<product_requirements>
The application is a calm, focused digital studio for a psychiatry resident, organized as a dynamic mind map. It features interconnected nodes for Psychiatric Topics, Patient Cases, and Tasks, displayed with a dark teal sidebar and floating card-styled nodes. Each node has dedicated detail modals/windows for information display and editing. Connections are represented by flowing, dotted gray lines with circular ports.

Evolving requirements have included:
- Full editability: drag & drop, node creation/deletion, and dynamic connection management.
- Hierarchical structure: Topics → Cases/Literature → Tasks, with a new Literature node type.
- Automatic saving of node positions and content edits.
- Sidebar filtering to arrange/zoom nodes horizontally based on category.
- Subpages opening as overlay modals, not separate routes.
- Realign Nodes button for -based hierarchical layout, applied automatically on load.
- Robust local data persistence () with debounced auto-saving and auto-loading.
- Patient Case CSV export functionality.
- Enhanced visual feedback for saving and export operations.
- Multiple connection handles on nodes (top, bottom, left, right).
- Resolution of subpage freezing issues.
- Intuitive deletion of nodes and connections with confirmation dialogs.
- Clear Map functionality for resetting the mind map.
- Ensuring persistence of newly created connections across mode changes and sessions.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and fix the critical bug where newly created connection lines (edges) disappear when exiting 'Edit Mind Map' mode or upon page refresh.
- Resolve difficulty loading data when trying to open subpages (potentially related to the above connection persistence or data flow).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a critical bug where newly created connection lines (edges) disappear from the mind map when exiting 'Edit Mind Map' mode or upon page refresh. This issue was first reported in Chat Message 487. The AI engineer previously attempted a fix in Chat Message 497 and believed it was resolved (Chat Message 504), but the user re-reported the issue in Chat Message 505, stating: The connections are still disappearing when switching in and out of edit mode and there is still difficulty loading data when trying to open the subpages.

The AI engineer's current approach (Chat Message 506) is to investigate the  function, suspecting it's not properly reconstructing connections upon mode changes or refresh. The AI also recognizes potential timing issues with subpage loading.

The last action was in Chat Message 508, where the AI engineer examined  to understand how connections are handled, noting its call upon edit mode switches and its reliance on existing . The engineer's next step is to analyze where  is called to identify where the logic fails to preserve newly created connections or if data is being incorrectly processed during the conversion from  to React Flow .
