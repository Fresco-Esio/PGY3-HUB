# PGY3-HUB Development Roadmap
**Updated:** October 8, 2025 (Evening - Post Edge Label Completion)  
**Status:** Phase 5 Complete - Refocusing on Core Vision

---

## üéØ Core Vision Clarification

**PGY3-HUB is a visual thinking tool for clinicians** to:
- Organize psychiatric knowledge through interconnected nodes
- Connect theory (Topics) to practice (Cases) to research (Literature)
- Document private clinical reflections outside the medical chart
- Study for boards using real case examples
- Create a "calm, focused digital studio for the mind"

**NOT a task management or productivity app.**

### Priority A: Focus Mode (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Business Value:** HIGH - Core to visual thinking workflow  
**Status:** üî¥ NOT STARTED

**What It Does:**
- Click any node (especially Topic) ‚Üí enter focus mode
- Selected node stays centered
- Connected nodes arrange in radial/web pattern around it
- Unconnected nodes fade to 10% opacity
- Smooth animated transitions
- Press ESC or click background to exit

**Features to Implement:**
1. **Focus Mode Activation**
   - [ ] Click handler for all nodes
   - [ ] Calculate 1st-degree connected nodes
   - [ ] Detect connection types and relationships
   - [ ] Enter focus mode animation

2. **Radial Layout Algorithm**
   - [ ] Position selected node at center
   - [ ] Arrange connected nodes in circle/web pattern
   - [ ] Calculate optimal spacing based on node count
   - [ ] Smooth animated repositioning

3. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - [ ] Selected node: 1.2x scale, bright glow
   - [ ] Connected nodes: Normal size, highlighted
   - [ ] Connection edges: Thicker, brighter
   - [ ] Unconnected nodes: 0.1 opacity, no interaction

4. **Exit Mechanism**
   - [ ] ESC key to exit
   - [ ] Click background to exit
   - [ ] Animate back to previous layout

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Task System - Detailed Plan

**Step 1: Data Model Updates**
```javascript
// Add to Task type
{
  id: number,
  label: string,
  description: string,
  dueDate: string | null,        // NEW: ISO 8601 date string
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'done' | 'blocked',  // NEW
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent',       // NEW
  completedAt: string | null,    // NEW: Timestamp
  linkedCaseId: number | null,   // NEW: Link to case
  subtasks: Array<{              // NEW: Checklist
    id: number,
    label: string,
    completed: boolean
  }>,
  notes: string,                 // Already have
  tags: string[],                // Already have
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string
}
```

**Step 2: TaskModal Enhancements**
- Add Due Date picker

- Add validation for new fields
- Ensure backward compatibility

---

### Literature Enhancement - Detailed Plan

**Step 1: PDF Viewer Integration**
```bash
npm install react-pdf pdfjs-dist
```

```javascript
// In LiteratureModal
import { Document, Page } from 'react-pdf';

const [numPages, setNumPages] = useState(null);
const [pageNumber, setPageNumber] = useState(1);

<Document
  file={`/api/uploads/${literature.pdfPath}`}
  onLoadSuccess={({ numPages }) => setNumPages(numPages)}
>
  <Page pageNumber={pageNumber} />
</Document>
```

**Step 2: Citation Export**
```javascript
const formatCitation = (lit, style) => {
  switch(style) {
    case 'APA':
      return `${lit.authors.join(', ')} (${lit.year}). ${lit.title}. ${lit.journal}.`;
    case 'MLA':
      return `${lit.authors[0]} et al. "${lit.title}." ${lit.journal} (${lit.year}).`;
    case 'Chicago':
      return `${lit.authors.join(', ')}. "${lit.title}." ${lit.journal} (${lit.year}).`;
  }
};
```

**Step 3: DOI Auto-Fill**
```javascript
const fetchDOI = async (doi) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.crossref.org/works/${doi}`);
  const data = response.data.message;
  return {
    title: data.title[0],
    authors: data.author.map(a => `${a.given} ${a.family}`),
    journal: data['container-title'][0],
    year: data.published['date-parts'][0][0]
  };
};
```

## ü§î Decision Time

### What Should We Build Next?

**I recommend starting with Option A: Task System Enhancement**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Highest business value** - Core to resident workflow
2. **Clear user need** - Task management is essential
3. **Builds on existing** - Task nodes already exist
4. **Manageable scope** - Can complete in one session
5. **Visible impact** - Users will immediately benefit

**Alternative: Quick Wins Combo**
If 4-6 hours feels like too much, we could do:
- Task completion checkbox (30 min)
- Due date display (30 min)  
- Basic PDF viewer (1 hour)
- Search results panel (1 hour)

**Total:** 3 hours, multiple features improved

---

## üé® Design Mockups Needed

Before implementing, we should sketch:
1. TaskModal with new fields
2. Task node with status/due date
3. Notification toast design
4. PDF viewer layout
5. Search results panel

Would you like me to provide ASCII mockups or should we dive into code?
