Console logs show drag events fire correctly ('ðŸ”· Drag started/ended') but NO double-click console logs ('Node double-clicked:') are generated. The D3Graph.js has proper double-click handlers (.on('dblclick', function(event, d) {...})) but Playwright double-click actions are being interpreted as drag events instead. This suggests the double-click event threshold/timing may be too sensitive or conflicting with drag handlers. All 18 node groups have D3 event handlers attached (hasD3Events=true) but double-click specifically is not working."
