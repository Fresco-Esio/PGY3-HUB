# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Fix critical connection persistence issues and implement UX improvements for the psychiatry resident dashboard:
  
  CRITICAL FIXES:
  1. Fix disappearing connection lines (edges) when exiting 'Edit Mind Map' mode or upon page refresh
  2. Resolve difficulty loading data when trying to open subpages
  
  UX IMPROVEMENTS:
  3. New nodes should generate in the center of the user's current view
  4. On opening the app, nodes should already be positioned correctly (no jumping/shifting)
  5. When "Realign Nodes" button is pressed, arrange nodes in columns by category type in the central viewing area

      message: "Verified backend API is still working correctly with the rich text editor changes. All tests passed successfully. The GET /api/mindmap-data endpoint correctly returns all data including topics, cases, tasks, literature, and connections. Data structures for all entity types are correct with proper position fields. The PUT /api/mindmap-data endpoint successfully updates and persists changes. Connection persistence is maintained with both old and new format handle IDs. Cross-entity connections work correctly. The backend API is fully functional and ready to support the frontend rich text editor changes."

      message: "CRITICAL FIXES IDENTIFIED: User reported persistent connection issues in preview environment. Analysis revealed: 1) Function declaration order problem - handleNodeHandleClick declared AFTER convertDataToReactFlow which uses it 2) Missing startHandle dependency in handleNodeHandleClick useCallback 3) Backend URL needs standardization to http://localhost:8001 4) Need to ensure ALL handles can connect to each other without restrictions 5) User prioritizes creation issue over visibility. Will fix these critical issues first before testing."
