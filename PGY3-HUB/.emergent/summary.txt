The previous AI engineer was tasked with validating, fixing, and enhancing the PGY3-HUB mind mapping application. The initial focus was on addressing critical functional issues, specifically the search functionality which caused a Maximum update depth exceeded error and interfered with node dragging and positioning. After multiple attempts to fix the search by reimplementing it with CSS classes, the user explicitly requested its complete removal if issues persisted, which was then successfully executed.

Following this, the focus shifted to the Clear All Data function, which was found to be fully operational. The main body of work then centered on the Case Modal's Timeline tab. This involved progressively refactoring the timeline to support inline editing, ensure entries were fully visible upon expansion (addressing persistent cut-off issues), and resolve React Router routing problems caused by event propagation. The latest task was to implement smooth hover animations on timeline entries. The engineer meticulously addressed each problem, leveraging semantic_search when stuck, and validated fixes via testing agents, often encountering and resolving new issues that arose from previous changes (e.g., event propagation blocking double-clicks).

The final phase involved setting up a complete Windows desktop distribution using Electron. This included resolving Windows permission issues with electron-builder, implementing a streamlined build process using the --dir flag to bypass code signing, and creating automated scripts for both development and release builds. The application is now fully distributable as a Windows executable with portable ZIP packaging.

<product_requirements>
The PGY3-HUB is a mind-mapping application for psychiatry residents to organize knowledge, cases, tasks, and literature. It features a React frontend with @xyflow/react for visualization, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a FastAPI/Python backend using local JSON storage. The application is now packaged as a Windows desktop application using Electron.

Initial requirements included:
*   Reviewing the existing repository for functionality.
*   Completing and fixing existing features.
*   Maintaining theme consistency.

Specific functional fixes and enhancements completed:
*   Ensuring all nodes are visible and correctly positioned.
*   Enabling and persisting node dragging.
*   Addressing node clustering and off-screen appearance.
*   Repairing/reimplementing search functionality to avoid interference with node interactions (ultimately completely removed due to persistent issues).
*   Restoring and verifying Clear All Data function (confirmed working).
*   Making the Case Modal's Timeline tab editable with:
    *   Inline creation and editing of timeline entries.
    *   Auto-saving updated case objects.
    *   Maintaining existing design, animations, and scrollability.
    *   Inline editing and dynamic expansion for each timeline entry.
    *   Ensuring expanded entries are fully visible via auto-scroll, preventing cut-offs.
    *   Implementing smooth Framer Motion animations for expansion/collapse and hover effects.
*   Creating Windows desktop distribution:
    *   Electron application packaging with automated build process.
    *   Resolving Windows permission issues with code signing bypass.
    *   Portable ZIP distribution for easy sharing.
    *   Automated release scripts with version management.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application handling RESTful API endpoints for mind map data.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned in the provided trajectory, but it's the target for frontend API calls.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages frontend Node.js dependencies and build scripts.
    -   **Changes**: 
        *   Dependencies updated for Electron development (electron, electron-builder, etc.)
        *   Build scripts added for Windows distribution: `build-win-quick`, `build-win-zip`
        *   Electron configuration added with proper file inclusion and code signing bypass
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores frontend environment variables, primarily .
    -   **Changes**:  was corrected to  for local backend communication.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component for mind map visualization and interaction. Integrates React Flow, handles state, node operations, and backend communication.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Search Functionality**: Initially, attempts were made to fix  and  circular dependencies. Ultimately, the *entire search functionality (state, effects, UI elements)* was completely removed due to persistent Maximum update depth exceeded errors and interference with node interactions.
        *   **Node Interaction**:  handler was fixed by modifying  calls in various node delete buttons (, , , etc.) to prevent blocking double-click events, allowing the CaseModal to open correctly. This involved distinguishing single vs. double clicks and adding timeouts.
        *   **Case ID Parsing**: The parsing logic for  in  was adjusted to correctly extract IDs for complex case node formats (e.g., case-12345-0-case).
        *   **Clear All Data**: The existing  function, which leverages , was verified and confirmed to be working correctly, clearing both UI and backend data.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/CaseModal.js**:
    -   **Summary**: React component for displaying and editing patient case details, including a comprehensive Timeline tab.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Timeline Editable Functionality (Initial)**: An input form was added for new entries (text, timestamp), along with auto-save to backend, preserving existing animations and scroll.
        *   **Timeline Refactoring (Inline Editing)**: The static Add Entry form was removed, replaced by a + Add Entry button that appends a blank, expanded, editable node. Each existing entry also became inline-editable upon click (type, timestamp, content fields).
        *   **Timeline Functionality Restoration (Latest)**: Complete Timeline functionality was restored after being previously removed. Added Timeline tab with Clock icon, comprehensive timeline entry management with 5 entry types (Assessment, Medication, Therapy, Follow-up, Note), color-coded visual design with vertical timeline line and gradient effects.
        *   **Visual Design Implementation**: Color-coded entries by type (green=Assessment, blue=Medication, purple=Therapy, orange=Follow-up, gray=Note), vertical timeline bar with colored dots, gradient fades at top/bottom for scrollability, dark theme styling consistent with existing modal.
        *   **Interactive Features**: Add Entry button with inline form creation, Entry Type dropdown, timestamp picker (datetime-local input), content textarea with validation, Save/Cancel buttons with proper state management, click to edit existing entries, Scroll to Latest button, auto-save with 800ms debounce.
        *   **Scroll Behavior**: Extensive work was done to ensure expanded entries (new or existing) are fully visible within the modal, preventing cut-offs. This involved `scrollToShowEditingEntry` function, `setTimeout` delays, `scrollTop` calculations, and dynamic padding adjustments.
        *   **Animation Smoothness**: Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` prop, custom easing, reduced delays, and `will-change` CSS property were used to improve animation fluidity and eliminate choppiness during expansion/collapse.
        *   **Data Management**: Backend persistence for all timeline changes, automatic scrolling to keep editing forms visible, form validation with disabled buttons when content empty, comprehensive timeline entry CRUD operations.
        *   **Sample Data Integration**: Enhanced case data with realistic patient information (Major Depressive Disorder, 28-year-old female) and 3 sample timeline entries demonstrating different entry types with proper metadata structure.
        *   **CSS Styling**: Custom scrollbar styling (width, track, thumb colors) was added to `timeline-scroll` and applied to the timeline container to make scrolling visible and functional.
        *   **Hover Effects**: Comprehensive hover effects implementation with height expansion, subtle glow, and smooth transitions using Framer Motion.
