## üéØ Project Overview

**PGY3-HUB** is a visual thinking tool for psychiatrists/psychologists to organize knowledge through an interactive mind map.

**Core Purpose:**
- Visual organization of Cases ‚Üî Topics ‚Üî Literature (the "knowledge triangle")
- Private clinical reflection space (notes outside medical charts)
- Board study tool using real case examples
- "Calm, focused digital studio for the mind"

**NOT:** A task management or productivity app. No deadlines, no notifications, no urgency.

## üìä Version System (CRITICAL)

### Current Version: v0.6.0

**Format:** `v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
- **MAJOR** (0.x.x): Architecture changes, complete overhauls
- **MINOR** (x.X.x): New features, significant enhancements
- **PATCH** (x.x.X): Bug fixes, small improvements

### When to Update Version

**PATCH (x.x.X)** - Increment for:
- Bug fixes
- Small UI improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring (no new features)

**MINOR (x.X.0)** - Increment for:
- New features
- Significant UI enhancements
- New components or modals
- API additions

**MAJOR (X.0.0)** - Increment for:
- Architecture changes
- Breaking changes
- Complete redesigns
- Major framework updates

## üìù MANDATORY: Update These Files After ANY Code Change

### 1. VERSION.md (ALWAYS)

**Location:** `/VERSION.md`

**What to update:**
```markdown
## Release History

### vX.X.X - "Feature Name" (Date)
**Status:** üöß In Development | ‚úÖ Released

**Focus:** Brief description

**Changes:**
- [x] What you just implemented
- [ ] What's still planned

**Bug Fixes:** (if applicable)
- Fixed [specific issue]

**Technical:** (if significant)
- New files created
- Major refactors
```

**Example:**
```markdown

- Modified handleNodeClick in App.js
```

---

### 2. ROADMAP.md (When Completing Tasks)

**Location:** `/ROADMAP.md`

**What to update:**

Mark tasks as complete:
```markdown
### Priority A: Focus Mode

**Features to Implement:**
1. **Focus Mode State Management**
   - [x] Add `focusMode` state to App.js  ‚Üê Change [ ] to [x]
   - [x] Add `focusedNode` state
   - [ ] Calculate connected nodes
```

Update status:
```markdown
### Priority A: Focus Mode (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status:** üöß In Progress ‚Üê Update this
**Progress:** 2/6 steps complete ‚Üê Add this
```

---

### 3. Implementation Plan (Active Work Doc)

**Location:** `/docs/development/FOCUS_MODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (or current feature doc)

**What to update:**

Mark checklist items:
```markdown
#### Step 1: Focus Mode State Management
- [x] Add `focusMode` state to App.js ‚Üê Change to [x]
- [x] Add `focusedNode` state to track selected node
- [ ] Add `originalLayout` state to store positions
```

Update progress table:
```markdown
| Task | Status | Time Spent | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Focus Mode - State | ‚úÖ Complete | 30min | Added 3 states |
| Focus Mode - Activation | üî¥ Not Started | - | Next up |
```

---

### 4. App UI Version Display (When Incrementing Version)

**Location:** `frontend/src/App.js` (around line 1602)

**What to update:**
```javascript
<div className="mt-2 text-xs text-slate-400 font-mono">v0.6.0 - Visual Clarity</div>
```

Change to new version and feature name:
```javascript
<div className="mt-2 text-xs text-slate-400 font-mono">v0.7.0 - Literature Integration</div>
```

**When to update:** When incrementing MINOR or MAJOR version (not PATCH)

---

### 5. Session Documentation (Optional but Recommended)

**Location:** `/docs/archive/SESSION_SUMMARY_[DATE].md`

Create at end of work session:
```markdown
# Session Summary - Oct 8, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed
- Focus mode state management
- Node click handler

## üöß In Progress
- Radial layout algorithm

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps
- Complete radial layout
- Add visual hierarchy

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Spent
- 1 hour

## üìù Notes

```

---

## üîÑ Workflow for Making Changes

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Before Starting:**
   - Read `/VERSION.md` to know current version
   - Read `/ROADMAP.md` to understand priorities
   - Read `/docs/development/[FEATURE]_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for current work plan

2. **While Coding:**
   - Make changes to code files
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document any decisions or issues

3. **After Completing a Feature/Fix:**
   - ‚úÖ Mark checklist items in implementation plan
   - ‚úÖ Update progress in ROADMAP.md
   - ‚úÖ Add entry to VERSION.md
   - ‚úÖ Increment version number if appropriate
   - ‚úÖ Update package.json version if releasing

4. **If Completing Multiple Small Tasks:**
   - Update docs after each logical unit
   - Don't wait until everything is done
   - Keep documentation in sync with code

---

## üìã File Organization Rules

### Active Work
**Location:** `/docs/development/`
- Current implementation plans
- Active feature specs
- Works in progress

**Example:** `FOCUS_MODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Completed Work
**Location:** `/docs/archive/`
- Finished implementation logs
- Historical session summaries
- Bug fix documentation

**When to move:** As soon as feature is complete and merged

### Feature Documentation
**Location:** `/docs/features/`
- User-facing feature docs
- API documentation
- Feature specifications

**Example:** `SPREADSHEET_IMPORT_FEATURE.md`

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### React Components
- Functional components with hooks
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety

### State Management
- Local state with `useState`
- Lift state up when needed
- No Redux (keeping it simple)

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Dark theme colors (slate/gray palette)
- Framer Motion for animations

### D3.js Integration
- D3 for visualization only (not React Flow)
- Force-directed graph layout
- Store simulation in refs, not state

---

## üêõ Bug Fix Protocol

### When Fixing a Bug:

1. **Document the bug:**
   ```markdown
   ### Bug: [Brief description]
   **Symptoms:** What's happening
   **Cause:** Root cause analysis
   **Fix:** What you changed
   ```

2. **Update VERSION.md:**
   ```markdown
   **Bug Fixes:**
   - Fixed [issue] by [solution]
   ```

3. **Increment PATCH version:**
   - If version is v0.6.0 ‚Üí v0.6.1
   - Update `package.json` files

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Verify fix works
   - Check for regressions
   - Update tests if applicable

---

## ‚úÖ Quality Checklist

Before considering any work "complete":

- [ ] Code changes tested and working
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Implementation plan checklist updated
- [ ] ROADMAP.md status updated
- [ ] VERSION.md entry added
- [ ] Version number incremented (if appropriate)
- [ ] Comments added to complex code

---

## üö® Critical Don'ts

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Make changes without updating documentation
- ‚ùå Skip version increments for features
- ‚ùå Leave implementation plans outdated
- ‚ùå Create new markdown files in root (use /docs)
- ‚ùå Delete archive files (they're historical record)
- ‚ùå Break the core vision (visual thinking, not productivity)
- ‚ùå Add notifications, deadlines, or urgency features

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Keep docs in sync with code
- ‚úÖ Update version system religiously
- ‚úÖ Follow the organizational structure
- ‚úÖ Test before documenting as complete
- ‚úÖ Preserve the "calm studio" aesthetic
- ‚úÖ Focus on visual clarity and organization

## üí° Tips for AI Assistants

1. **Always read context first:**
   - Check VERSION.md for current version
   - Read ROADMAP.md for priorities
   - Review implementation plan for current work

2. **Document as you go:**
   - Don't wait until feature is complete
   - Update checklists after each step
   - Add notes about decisions or issues

3. **Be specific in updates:**
   - "Added focus mode state" not "Updated App.js"
   - Include line numbers or function names
   - Note any tricky parts or gotchas

4. **Maintain the vision:**
   - This is a visual thinking tool, not a task manager
   - Calm and focused, not urgent and gamified
   - Beauty and clarity over features and complexity

5. **Ask when unclear:**
   - Version increment unclear? Ask user
   - Feature scope ambiguous? Clarify
   - Documentation format uncertain? Follow examples

## ‚úÖ You're Ready!

With these guidelines, you should be able to:
- Make code changes that fit the project vision
- Update all documentation appropriately
- Follow the version system correctly
- Keep the codebase organized and professional

**Remember:** Documentation is as important as code. Keep them in sync!
