CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: While Cytoscape.js is loading and nodes exist in memory (24 nodes detected), NO NODES ARE VISIBLE on the canvas. The incremental update system appears to be working (console shows proper node processing), but there's a critical rendering/display issue preventing users from seeing any nodes.",
