## 📋 Documentation Updates (COMPLETE)

### Files Updated
1. ✅ **ROADMAP_OCTOBER_8_2025.md** - Complete roadmap overhaul
2. ✅ **REMAINING_WORK.md** - Updated priorities based on vision
3. ✅ **WHATS_NEXT_CONVERSATION.md** - Vision clarification discussion
4. ✅ **FOCUS_MODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - NEW - Detailed implementation plan

### Key Changes
- Clarified core vision (visual thinking tool, NOT task manager)
- Reprioritized based on user need for visual organization
- Moved Focus Mode + Smart Layout to top priority
- Demoted task system (doesn't fit vision)
- Added detailed implementation checklist

## 🎯 Next Steps (READY TO START)

### Phase 1: Focus Mode (2-3 hours)
**User Need:** "Being able to visually see the connected cases at once"

**What to Build:**
1. Click node → enter focus mode
2. Selected node centers in viewport
3. Connected nodes arrange in radial/web pattern
4. Unconnected nodes fade to 10% opacity
5. ESC or click background to exit
6. Smooth animations throughout

**Files to Modify:**
- `App.js` - State management, enter/exit functions
- `D3Graph.js` - Click handlers, visual rendering, animations

---

### Phase 2: Smart Layout (1-2 hours)
**User Need:** Fix realign button to actually work well

**What to Build:**
1. Cluster detection algorithm
2. Hierarchical arrangement (Topics as centers)
3. Enhanced force simulation
4. Proper realign button implementation

**Files to Modify:**
- `App.js` - forceLayout function
- Possibly create `utils/clusterDetection.js`

## 🎨 Vision Alignment

### Core Purpose (Clarified)
PGY3-HUB is a **visual thinking tool** for clinicians to:
- Organize psychiatric knowledge (Cases ↔ Topics ↔ Literature)
- Document private clinical reflections
- Study for boards with case examples
- Experience a "calm, focused digital studio"

### What We're Building Toward
- Visual clarity (focus mode, smart layout)
- Connection visibility (radial web layouts)
- Pattern discovery (see relationships)
- Calm aesthetic (no urgency, beautiful design)

### What We're NOT Building
- ❌ Task management with deadlines
- ❌ Notifications and reminders
- ❌ Productivity features
- ❌ Gamification
